## The objective of this project was to make a combination of Logic programming, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
## Project from a course. In this project I added many CSS styles, I created a line background image and I inserted Bootstrap in this project to be mobile-first.



Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skills invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates,[1] with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
